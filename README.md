Password-Generator
Developed a GUI-based password generator using Java Swing Framework, featuring toggle buttons and input fields for user-defined password criteria.
Implemented password generation logic with options for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters, leveraging randomized algorithms for secure output.
Applied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by modularizing the application into distinct classes for GUI rendering and backend password generation.
Designed an intuitive user interface that supports real-time feedback and displays generated passwords, ensuring ease of use and functionality.
